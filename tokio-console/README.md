## Overview

[`tokio-console`] is a debugging and profiling tool for asynchronous Rust
applications, which collects and displays in-depth diagnostic data on the
asynchronous tasks, resources, and operations in an application. The console
system consists of two primary components:

* &#x1f4e1;&#xfe0f; _instrumentation_, embedded in the application, which
  collects data from the async runtime and exposes it over the console's wire
  format
* &#x1f6f0;&#xfe0f; _consumers_, which connect to the instrumented application,
  receive telemetry data, and display it to the user

This crate is the primary consumer of `tokio-console` telemetry, a command-line
application that provides an interactive debugging interface.

[wire format]: https://crates.io/crates/console-api
[subscriber]: https://crates.io/crates/console-subscriber
## Getting Started

To use the console to monitor and debug a program, it must be instrumented to
emit the data the console consumes. Then, the `tokio-console` CLI application
can be used to connect to the application and monitor its operation.
### Instrumenting the Application

Before the console can connect to an application, it must first be instrumented
to record `tokio-console` telemetry. The easiest way  to do this is [using the
`console-subscriber` crate][subscriber].

`console-subscriber` requires that the application's async runtime (or runtimes)
emit [`tracing`] data in a format that the console can record. For programs that
use the [Tokio] runtime, this means that:

- Tokio's [unstable features][unstable] must be enabled. See [the `console-subscriber`
  documentation][unstable] for details.
- A [compatible Tokio version][versions] must be used. Tokio v1.0 or greater is required
  to use the console, and some features are only available in later versions.
  See [the `console-subscriber` documentation][versions] for details.

[`tracing`]: https://crates.io/crates/tracing
[unstable]: https://docs.rs/console-subscriber/0.1/console_subscriber/#enabling-tokio-instrumentation
[versions]: https://docs.rs/console-subscriber/0.1/console_subscriber/#required-tokio-versions

### Using the Console

Once the application is instrumented, install the console CLI using

```shell
cargo install --locked tokio-console
```

Running `tokio-console` without any arguments will connect to an application on
localhost listening on the default port, port 6669:

```shell
tokio-console
```

If the application is not running locally, or was configured to listen on a
different port, the console will also accept a target address as a command-like
argument:

```shell
tokio-console http://192.168.0.42:9090
```

A DNS name can also be provided as the target address:
```shell
tokio-console http://my.instrumented.application.local:6669
```

See [here][cli-ref] for a complete list of all command-line arguments.

Tokio Console has a number of different views:
* [Tasks List](#tasks-list)
* [Task Details](#task-details)
* [Resources List](#resources-list)
* [Resource Details](#resource-details)

#### running the console on windows

The console uses the UTF-8 character set to display graphs and other visual
features in the terminal. In order to display this rich terminal UI on Windows,
it's necessary to use a UTF-8-enabled terminal emulator, such as the new
[Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install).

If you're using a terminal that supports UTF-8, make sure to explicitly call
tokio-console with the UTF-8 language flag set:
```shell
tokio-console --lang en_US.UTF-8
```

### Tasks List

When the console CLI is launched, it displays a list of all [asynchronous tasks]
in the program:

![tasks list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tokio-rs/console/main/assets/tokio-console-0.1.13/tasks_list.png)

Tasks are displayed in a table.

* `Warn` - The number of warnings active for the task.
* `ID` - The ID of the task. This is the same as the value returned by the unstable [`tokio::task::Id`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/task/struct.Id.html) API (see documentation for details).
* `State` - The state of the task.
  * `RUNNING`/‚ñ∂ - Task is currently being polled.
  * `IDLE`/‚è∏ - Task is waiting on some resource.
  * `SCHED`/‚è´ - Task is scheduled (it has been woken but not yet polled).
  * `DONE`/‚èπ - Task has completed.
* `Name` - The name of the task, which can be set when spawning a task using the unstable [`tokio::task::Builder::name()`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/task/struct.Builder.html#method.name) API.
* `Total` - Duration the task has been alive (sum of Busy, Sched, and Idle).
* `Busy` - Total duration for which the task has been actively executing.
* `Sched` - Total duration for which the task has been scheduled to be polled by the runtime.
* `Idle` - Total duration for which the task has been idle (waiting to be woken).
* `Polls` - Number of times the task has been polled.
* `Target` - The target of the span used to record the task.
  * `tokio::task` - Async task.
  * `tokio::task::blocking` - A blocking task (created with [tokio::task::spawn_blocking](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/task/fn.spawn_blocking.html)).
* `Location` - The source code location where the task was spawned from.
* `Fields` - Additional fields on the task span.
  * `kind` - may be `task` (for async tasks) or `blocking` (for blocking tasks).
  * `fn` - function signature for blocking tasks. Async tasks don't record this field, as it is generally very large when using `async`/`await`.

Using the <kbd>&#8593;</kbd> and <kbd>&#8595;</kbd> arrow keys, an individual task can be highlighted.
Pressing<kbd>enter</kbd> while a task is highlighted displays details about that
task.

### Task Details

This view shows details about a specific task:

![task details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tokio-rs/console/main/assets/tokio-console-0.1.13/task_details.png)

The task details view includes percentiles and a visual histogram of the polling (busy) times
and scheduled times.

Pressing the <kbd>escape</kbd> key returns to the task list.

### Resources List

The <kbd>r</kbd> key switches from the list of tasks to a list of [resources],
such as synchronization primitives, I/O resources, et cetera:

![resource list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tokio-rs/console/main/assets/tokio-console-0.1.13/resources_list.png)

Resources are displayed in a table similar to the task list.

* `ID` - The ID of the resource. This is a display ID as there is no internal resource ID to reference.
* `Parent` - The ID of the parent resource if it exists.
* `Kind` - The resource kind, this is a high level grouping of resources.
  * `Sync` - Synchronization resources from [`tokio::sync`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/index.html) such as [`Mutex`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/struct.Mutex.html).
  * `Timer` - Timer resources from [`tokio::time`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/time/index.html) such as [`Sleep`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/time/struct.Sleep.html).
* `Total` - Total duration that this resource has been alive.
* `Target` - The module path of the resource type.
* `Type` - The specific type of the resource, possible values depend on the resources instrumented in Tokio, which may vary between versions.
* `Vis` - The visibility of the resource.
  * `INT`/üîí - Internal, this resource is only used by other resources.
  * `PUB`/‚úÖ - Public, available in the public Tokio API.
* `Location` - The source code location where the resource was created.
* `Attributes` - Additional resource-dependent attributes, for example a resource of type `Sleep` record the `duration` of the sleep.

Pressing the <kbd>t</kbd> key switches the view back to the task list.

Like the task list view, the resource list view can be navigated using the
<kbd>&#8593;</kbd> and <kbd>&#8595;</kbd> arrow keys. Pressing <kbd>enter</kbd>
while a resource is highlighted displays details about that resource.

### Resource Details

![resource details --- sleep](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tokio-rs/console/main/assets/tokio-console-0.1.13/resource_details_sleep.png)

The resource details view lists the tasks currently waiting on that resource.
This may be a single task, as in the [`tokio::time::Sleep`] above, or
a large number of tasks, such as this private `tokio::sync::batch_semaphore::Semaphore`:

![resource details --- semaphore](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tokio-rs/console/main/assets/tokio-console-0.1.13/resource_details_semaphore.png)

The resource details view includes a table of async ops belonging to the resource.

* `ID` - The ID of the async op. This is a display ID similar to those recorded for resources.
* `Parent` - The ID of the parent async op, if it exists.
* `Task` - The ID and name of the task which performed this async op.
* `Source` - The method where the async op is being called from.
* `Total` - Total duration for which the async op has been alive (sum of Busy and Idle, as an async op has no scheduled state).
* `Busy` - Total duration for which the async op has been busy (its future is actively being polled).
* `Idle` - Total duration for which the async op has been idle (the future exists but is not being polled).
* `Polls` - Number of times the async op has been polled.
* `Attributes` - Additional attributes from the async op. These will vary based on the type of the async op.

Like the task details view, pressing the <kbd>escape</kbd> key while viewing a resource's details
returns to the resource list.

A configuration file (`console.toml`) can be used to configure the console's
behavior. See [the documentation][cfg-ref] for details.
